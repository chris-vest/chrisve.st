## Who am I?

My name is Chris Vest and I work as a DevOps Engineer in London, United Kingdom.

## What is this?

This is my personal website.

## Why?

In December 2018, I read an [article discussing how a personal website could replace Facebook](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbanny/we-should-replace-facebook-with-personal-websites). Over the last few years I have become increasingly frustrated with social media - as such I was intrigued with this idea. I decided to give it a go, with the intention of perhaps phasing out other forms of social media entirely.

The other motivation is that I expect to be contributing more and more to open source tools. I want to document these posts, contributions, etc., as well as any useful information I can share with the community.

## What to expect?

Technical articles about things I'm working on either at work or in my free time. I imagine the focus will be on Kubernetes and any learnings I encounter along the way.
